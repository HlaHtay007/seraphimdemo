            <p>
                We are Francisan. We are Catholic. We are Christian.
            <br> <br>Everything we are or do stems from these non-exclusive perspectives and identities.
            <br> <br>Based on the long 1700 year history of Catholic education in the West and the Middle East since the days of the First Desert Fathers, we stress moral and spiritual development as we teach academic studies to our students who come to study with us.
            <br><br>Seeing the need for quality tertiary education for the poor of Burma (Myanmar) Tuition is free for all of our students having been paid by donors. Our professors are all volunteers motivated only by service to the poor. College tuition is beyond the reach of the Burmese poor and thus we serve an important niche here in Rangoon (Yangon) Burma (Myanmar.)
            <br><br>For them, we are a lifeline out of poverty and a means for them to help themselves and their families.
            <br><br>We are named after the Seraphim, the highest ranked angels—those seven spirits who stand before God and offer praise, worship and our prayers to Him. Thus, our Patrons are Archangels Michael, Gabriel and Raphael. We chose seraphim as a sign and request for them to assist these poorest of the poor who otherwise live in bleak darkness. These three archangels have served our college well.

                Seraphim College is one of several projects of the Norwegian Christian NGO, Caridad. Founded in 2011, Caridad has financed several projects throughout Burma including  bringing WiFi to several rural communities which subsequently allowed Seraphim to start an elementary school in Chaung Oo, Burma and to augment an already existing so-called “temple school” with new classes, instructors and computer equipment thus serving the needs of those two communities.
            <br><br>In addition, Caridad, has also built or refurbished and stocked two clinics on the Saigang Region in Central Burma. It also built and financed a youth center, a gym and a basketball court in the same region.
            <br><br>In Northern Burma’s Chin State—the foothills of the Himalayas—Caridad built an additional elementary/middle school and a Montessori-style kindergarten.
